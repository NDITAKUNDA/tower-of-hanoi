# Tower of Hanoi Solver

## 🏗️ Project Overview
This project provides a solution to the **Tower of Hanoi** problem using recursion. The objective of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle is to move all discs (or tires) from one pole to another, following specific rules. This implementation solves the puzzle efficiently using Java.

The project simulates a real-life team-building experience where I encountered this puzzle, struggled with it initially, and then figured out the recursive solution!

## 🚀 Features
- Solves the Tower of Hanoi for any number of discs.
- Displays the sequence of moves needed to complete the puzzle.
- Utilizes a recursive approach to break down the problem.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Java**

## 📜 Rules of the Puzzle
1. Only one disc can be moved at a time.
2. A disc can only be placed on top of another if it is smaller.
3. The goal is to move all discs from the source pole to the destination pole using an auxiliary pole.

## 📝 How to Run the Code
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NDITAKUNDA/tower-of-hanoi.git
    ```
2. Open the project in your favorite Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans).
3. Run the `TowerOfHanoi` class to see the solution in action.

## 📂 Project Structure
- **TowerOfHanoi.java**: The main class where the recursive logic is implemented.
- **README.md**: This documentation file.

## 🔍 Example Output
The program will output the steps to solve the puzzle for a given number of discs. For example, for 3 discs:
- Move disc 1 from A to C
- Move disc 2 from A to B
- Move disc 1 from C to B
- Move disc 3 from A to C
- Move disc 1 from B to A
- Move disc 2 from B to C
- Move disc 1 from A to C
- ...


## 📚 Learning Points
- Recursion is a powerful tool for solving problems that involve repetitive, similar steps.
- Breaking down complex challenges into smaller steps is essential for efficient problem-solving.
- The Tower of Hanoi puzzle is a great example of how algorithms can be applied to real-world problems.
